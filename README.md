# Coursera Data Science Specialization Course 9 Project Documentation

---

This repo contain the two files needed to run the Shiny app created for the course project.

To get started, please visit the following URL to access the app:
(https://snamjoshi.shinyapps.io/Correlation_MPG/)

The sidebar on the left has a few options that allow the user to manipulate the data displayed in main column. 

- The "Select a variable" drop down menu contains all remaining variables in the `mtcars` data set (with MPG omitted). Selecting a variable from here will update the graph and plot this variable on the x axis against mpg.
- The "Show labels" radio button displays the label for each observation. In this case it lists the specific car whose data is graphed in the main column.
- The "Confidence interval" slider allows the user to manipulate the confidence interval around the regression line that is plotted in the main column.
- The "R-squared" box displays the R-squared value for the linear regression through the data points from the variable selected.

Manipulating any of the first three options listed above will update the plot automatically.
